## Introduction

The stock price prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast stock prices based on historical data. By training models on past stock prices and relevant features, the project aims to predict future price movements.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bashÂ 
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd stock-price-prediction
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

1. Prepare the data:
* Collect historical stock price data using a data provider or API.

* Preprocess the data by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it as necessary.

2. Train the models:
* Select the appropriate machine learning algorithms for stock price prediction.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Train the models using the training data.

3. Evaluate the models:
* Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

* Compare the performance of different models.

4. Predict stock prices:
Use the trained models to make predictions on new, unseen data.
Visualize the predicted prices and compare them with the actual prices.

# Data Collection
The project requires historical stock price data to train and test the models. Various data providers and APIs offer access to this data. Examples include Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Quandl. Choose a suitable data provider and collect the required data.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the data for machine learning. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, normalizing the features, and transforming the data as necessary. Implement the necessary preprocessing steps based on the characteristics of the data and the requirements of the chosen machine learning algorithms.

# Model Training
Select the appropriate machine learning algorithms for stock price prediction. Commonly used algorithms include linear regression, support vector machines, random forests, and recurrent neural networks. Train the models using the preprocessed data and tune the hyperparameters to optimize performance.

# Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or accuracy. Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one for stock price prediction.

# Results
Present the results of the stock price prediction models. Include visualizations of predicted prices compared to actual prices. Discuss the performance of the models and any insights gained from the analysis.
